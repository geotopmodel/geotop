 PRAIRIE BLOWING SNOW MODEL CODE

 Code written by Stefano Endrizzi by translating and adapting the idea behind the PBSM Fortran Code
 by John Pomeroy. The author does not guarantee the perfect conformance of this code with the Fortran one.
 However, he asks to give credit to Pomeroy, 1993, when using it with satisfaction.
