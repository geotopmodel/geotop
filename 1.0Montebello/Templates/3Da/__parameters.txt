/**  2 block -  WATER FLOW PARAMETERS
a) Subsurface flow -> Integration of Richard's equation (1D or 3D): 1D means that the equation 
is solved in the pressure [mm], and the lateral flow is put at the know term (being the lateral gradient
of the pressure very low in most applicatiosn); 3D means that the equation is solved in the total 
head [mm], and vertical and lateral flow are solved together.
1. 	Reduction factor of the hydraulic conductivity in partially frozen soil (K=K_no_ice*10^(impedence*Q), where Q is the ice ratio)
	suggested values: from 0 to 7, best value 4
2. 	Absolute Tolerance for the integration of Richards' equation (on the Euclidean norm of residuals) 
	Be aware that it is related with the mass balance error, 
	in particular total mass balance error [mm] = sum(i) i-th componenet of residual vector
	suggested values: from 1.E-3 to 1.E-7
	to lower value, the higher computing time
3. 	Max iterations for the integration of Richards' equation
	if it is set at a value too low, you run the risk not having convergence and having high mass balance error
	you don't necessarily have a slower code if you set high iteration number, because normally Richards converges after 10 iterations or so
	suggested values, between 20 and 50
4.	Initial forcing term of Newton method 
 	the newton method looks for a solution such that
 	norm F(x,n+1) <= forcing term * norm F(x,n)
 	where F is the function of which we are finding the zero, x the unknown and n the iteration index
 	the forcing term is updated after any iteration according to the value of the norm F(x,n), but you have to
 	give an initial value. This value may affect the convergence, but it is not normally very important.
 	Values suggested, between 0.01 and 0.9, if you don't know use 0.1
	
b) Surface flow -> Solved explicitely assuming the law of uniform motion to be valid
The solved variable is named h_sup, and represents the water depth above the pixels. If h_sup>0,
the pressure at the surface of the soil column (Psurface) is equal to h_sup.

5.  Exponent (gamma) of the law of uniform motion on the surface v=C_m*(h_sup^gamma)*i^0.5
	If you use Manning, set it a 0.667
6.  Threshold on h_sup [mm] above which C_m is independent from h_sup (= fully developed turbulence). 
	For h_sup>threshold the value of C_m used is the one given in block 1.
	This prevents from slowing down too much the code if you set restrictions on the Courant number below when
	the surface water level (h_sup) is too low. Suggested values 10-50 mm
     
d) Channel flow

7. Cm coefficient for the channel flow (the same gamma for surface flow is used)
8. Threshold on h_sup [mm] above which C_m is independent from h_sup (= fully developed turbulence). 
	For h_sup>threshold the value of C_m used is the one given above. Suggested values 100-500 mm  
9. K_ch/b [1/s]: hydraulic conductivity of the sediments divided by sediment thickness
10. w_dx: channel width / pixel width
11. Depression of the channel bed with respect to the neighbouring slopes [mm] - this is used to change
between free and submerged weir flow model to represent to surface flow to the channel
